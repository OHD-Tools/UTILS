# Utils

# Log Readers

Using the Log Readers will require some Additional Dependencies to be present. These are not shipped with the package to cut down on package size by 273.5kb for a relatively niche feature.

## Tail Reader (Local)

This will require you install the package `tail@^2.2.6`

## FTP Reader (Remote)

This will require you install the package `basic-ftp@^5.0.5`

## SFTP Reader (Remote Secure)

This will require you install the package `ssh2-sftp-client@^10.0.3`

This is HEAVILY adapted from Thomas-Smyth's work on [ftp-tail](https://github.com/Thomas-Smyth/ftp-tail)
